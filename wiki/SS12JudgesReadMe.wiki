= Project Description =

Flashcards are incredibly useful study aids. For persons with cognitive 

and/or learning disabilities flashcards are practically a necessity. 

Some digital flash card solutions exist, but are platform specific and
 
have limited capabilities. 

A web-based flashcard solution could be 

accessible on multiple platforms and could support math and other 

complex equations. This would be quite beneficial to a person with a 

cognitive or learning disability. For example a user could create a set 

of flashcards of mathematic equations conveniently on their computer. 

The user can then access and edit the flash cards from their mobile 

device, eliminating the need for physical cards.
