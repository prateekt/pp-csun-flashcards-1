= Document Purpose =
This is an Unofficial introduction to the Accessible Flashcards

project by team CSUN. The purpose of this document is to give a 

brief introduction and overview of our project submission to

SS12. In this document you will find the description, requirements,

accomplishments, technologies used, and a high level mapping of the

source files checked into SVN. This is an attempt to help judges

understand our project and to provide a simplified overview of the

source files checked into SVN.

*This document does not contain official project documentation nor*

*future project maintainability plans. Explanation of components and*

*innovative ideas are also not explained. All of this will be covered*

*and presented at the SS12 Finals.*



= Project Description =

Flashcards are incredibly useful study aids. For persons with cognitive 

and/or learning disabilities flashcards are practically a necessity. 

Some digital flash card solutions exist, but are platform specific and
 
have limited capabilities. 

A web-based flashcard solution could be 

accessible on multiple platforms and could support math and other 

complex equations. This would be quite beneficial to a person with a 

cognitive or learning disability. For example a user could create a set 

of flashcards of mathematic equations conveniently on their computer. 

The user can then access and edit the flash cards from their mobile 

device, eliminating the need for physical cards.
